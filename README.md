Public Malware Sources
======================

I found all of these samples on [MalwareTech](http://www.malwaretech.com/p/sources.html) through Twitter somewhere, so the malware itself is by no means discovered by me. Figured a Github repository would be a better place for them. 

None of these were made by me and I take no resonsibility for anything done with the code. This is all just for research purposes.

Included Malware
----------------
* Dexter v2 (Point of Sales Trojan)
* Rovnix (Bootkit)
